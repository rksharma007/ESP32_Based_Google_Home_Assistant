# ESP32_Based_Google_Home_Assistant
The project has proposed the idea of home assistant that can support a lot of home automation systems.
Home Assistant is a device which integrates various components that are used to automate things around us. IoT is Internet of Things which denotes the intercommunication among devices by using an embedded system. The backbone of Home Automation is the Home Assistant which means controlling all the appliances without going close to the switches to control them. Automation has become cost-effective using embedded systems. An embedded system provides user comfort, security and flexibility along with maintaining the living standard. This Automation comprises of controllers, here a cheap micro-controller. The automatic control system created in this project uses ESP32. ESP32 is a microcontroller equipped with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology; the ESP32 development kit can be easily found on the market at a low price. Using this board and google assistant we will make a voice controlled system to automate the appliances.
